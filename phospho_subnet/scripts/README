Scripts and executables that are useful for these results.

Step 1: Process Matt's data files so that they can be input to my pathfinder program. (This entails giving modules short IDs, removing dashes from gene names, putting the files into a slightly different cosmetic format, and extracting various subsets of information from them.)

Step 2: Run the pathfinder program on DTT and NaCl to generate input files for the IP solver.

Step 3 (not here): Run the IP solver and retrieve results.

Step 4: Visualize input and results in Cytoscape.
