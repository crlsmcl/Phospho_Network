Contains scripts and results for setting up and running the ILP to infer subnetworks.

Step 1 (step1_gen_input_data.sh): Process Matt's data files so that they can be input to my pathfinder program. (This entails giving modules short IDs, removing dashes from gene names, putting the files into a slightly different cosmetic format, and extracting various subsets of information from them.)

Step 2 (step2_run_pathfinder.sh): Run the pathfinder program on DTT and NaCl to generate input files for the IP solver.

Step 3: Run the IP solver and retrieve results. This is done in the pathfinder/ directory.  (see pathfinder/scripts/set_up_local.sh and process_lesion.sh for before/after. GAMS is invoked manually.)


step1R, step2R pertain to running the ILP on randomized input data. See more information in the rand_ilp directory.
