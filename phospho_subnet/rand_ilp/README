This directory contains input and output files for running the ILP subnet inference on the randomized background networks and submodules.

(1) From ../scripts, these scripts were run (from the scripts directory)

step1R_gen_rand_input_data.sh (Generates ILP-friendly input from the randomized submodule files)

step2R_run_pathfinder_rand.sh (Uses randomized BG nets and their submodules to identify candidate paths)

(2) To set up individual GAMS models, run scripts/set_up_local.sh from this directory. This creates the run_NaCl* subdirectories.

(3) From within each subdirectory, invoke GAMS: gams run_lesion.gms lo=2

(4) After completion, run process_lesion.sh per directory to compile results.


Contents
--------
NaCl_rand_node_rankings:
	Contains the final node rankings from the 5 ILP runs.

config:
	Contains the config file for the pathfinding step

input_data: 
	NaCl_RAND/ processed input data
	network/ randomized background networks, formatted for ILP
	
pathfinder: 
	scripts: scripts for setting up and processing GAMS/CPLEX

	model: ILP modeled in GAMS
	NaCl_rand{0-4}: result of running step2R_run_pathfinder_rand.sh - input files for GAMS/CPLEX
	run_NaCl_rand{0-4}: after running scripts/set_up_local.sh and then solving run_lesion.gms with GAMS.
		cyto: cytoscape format results
		gdx: raw GAMS output (deleted for space concerns)
		result: processed gams output (individual solutions tarred up into solution_dumps.tar.gz; summarized results in path_x.tab (edges), path_y.tab (nodes), path_sigma.tab (paths)
