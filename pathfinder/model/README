model.gms is common to any run mode or dataset
One template each for lesion mode (after each IP solution, hold aside any non-module,non-source node from previous solution with 5% probability)
and pool mode (use CPLEX solution pool to make ensemble)

cplex option files are loaded in the GAMS script.
cplex.opt is used for one solution;
cplex.op2 is used for the solution pool
